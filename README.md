# BPMN for research
A collection of BPMN diagrams that can be used for research purposes.

## Where are these diagrams from and how were they created?
These diagrams were created in BPMN training sessions provided by Camunda. At the end of the training chapters, the participants completed several excersises. They were presented with a scenario in text form and, based on that, they created BPMN diagrams. There is a model solution that the participants did not see before completing the excersises.
