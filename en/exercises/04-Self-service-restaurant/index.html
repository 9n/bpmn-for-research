<h1 id="self-service-restaurant">Self Service Restaurant</h1>
<h2 id="the-task">The task</h2>
<p><em>Please model the following process:</em></p>
<p>A guest enters the restaurant when feeling hungry. He chooses a dish from the changing meal range and waits until it is his turn. Following this he places his order with the employee. The employee enters the order into the POS system and collects the money from the guest. After the payment, the employee sets up a buzzer and passes it on to the guest with the following information: &quot;When the buzzer rings, your dinner is ready&quot;.
Afterwards the employee informs the chef of the new meal order. The chef prepares the meal and places it in the service hatch. He then informs the employee that he has placed the finished meal in the service hatch.
As soon as the employee is aware that the meal is ready he sets off the guestâ€™s buzzer. This is how the guest finds out that his meal is ready for collection. He can pick up his meal and eat it. As soon as the guest appears at the service hatch, the employee hands over his meal. Should a guest not react to the buzzer, the employee calls for him after 5 minutes, if necessary several times in a row.</p>
<p>Tip: Use 3 different pools for the model</p>
<ul>
<li>Guest (food consumption)</li>
<li>Employee (order processing)</li>
<li>Chef (meal preparation)</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Background</em>
A self-service restaurant is under chaotic conditions. Guests place their order at the till and receive their meals on call from the kitchen. As the restaurant is very popular, the processes need to be adapted to the increasing visitor numbers. In future, guests should only be in touch with one member of staff for their order. The chef should purely be concentrating on preparing the meals. Buzzers will be introduced to signalise to customers when their order has been completed.</p>
