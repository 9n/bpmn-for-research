# Recourse

## The task

*Please model the following process:*
If an insurant could be possibly subrogated against, I get information about that. I check that case and if the possibility is really there, I send a request for payment to the insurant and make me a reminder. If recourse is not possible, I close the case.
When we receive the money, I make a booking and close the case. If the insurant disagrees with the recourse, I’ll have to check the reasoning of that. If he is right, I simply close the case. If he is wrong, I forward the case to a collection agency.
It the deadline for disagreement is reached and we haven’t received any money, I forward the case to the collection agency as well.

*Background*
Insurants can be forced to pay back money they received from the insurance company for different reasons. This is called recourse. Here the clerk describes how this process works.
