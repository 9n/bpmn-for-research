## Where are these diagrams from and how were they created?

These diagrams were created in [BPMN training](http://camunda.com/bpmn/training/) sessions provided by Camunda. At the end of the training chapters, the participants completed several excersises. They were presented with a scenario in text form and, based on that, they created BPMN diagrams. There is a model solution that the participants did not see before completing the excersises.
